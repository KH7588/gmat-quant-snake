Let's test k=1. 639170 / 7 = 91310. Since it divides evenly for k=1, 7 is a possible divisor. **Possible.**\r\n\r\nTherefore, 4 cannot be a divisor. The correct answer is C.`\r\n  },\r\n  12: {\r\n    id: 'A2-q12',\r\n    text: 'If n is an odd number, and the remainder when n is divided by 7 is 4. Which of the following could be divisible by 14?',\r\n    options: [\r\n        {label: \"A\", text: \"n+3\"},\r\n        {label: \"B\", text: \"n+5\"},\r\n        {label: \"C\", text: \"n+7\"},\r\n        {label: \"D\", text: \"n+9\"},\r\n        {label: \"E\", text: \"n+11\"},\r\n    ],\r\n    correctAnswer: 'A',\r\n    explanation: `From the given information:\r\n1.  n is odd.\r\n2.  When n is divided by 7, the remainder is 4. This can be written as n = 7k + 4 for some integer k.\r\n\r\nSubstitute condition 2 into condition 1:\r\nn = 7k + 4 must be odd. Since 4 is even, 7k must be odd. For 7k to be odd, k must be an odd integer.\r\n\r\nNow we need to find which option is divisible by 14 (i.e., divisible by both 2 and 7).\r\n\r\n-   **Check for divisibility by 7:**\r\n    (A) n+3 = (7k+4)+3 = 7k+7 = 7(k+1). This is always divisible by 7.\r\n    (B) n+5 = (7k+4)+5 = 7k+9. Not divisible by 7.\r\n    (C) n+7 = (7k+4)+7 = 7k+11. Not divisible by 7.\r\n    (D) n+9 = (7k+4)+9 = 7k+13. Not divisible by 7.\r\n    (E) n+11 = (7k+4)+11 = 7k+15. Not divisible by 7.\r\n    Only option (A) is always divisible by 7.\r\n\r\n-   **Check option (A) for divisibility by 2:**\r\n    We need to check if n+3 is even. We are given that n is odd.\r\n    n+3 = (odd) + (odd) = even.\r\n    So, n+3 is always divisible by 2.\r\n\r\nSince n+3 is always divisible by 7 and always divisible by 2, it is always divisible by their least common multiple, 14.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is A.`\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n"],
