Then rs=9, which is divisible by 9. (r-s) = 9-1 = 8, which is not divisible by 3. (Answer: NO)\r\n- Case B: Let r=3, s=3. Then rs=9, which is divisible by 9. (r-s) = 3-3 = 0, which is divisible by 3. (Answer: YES)\r\nSince we get both YES and NO answers, Statement (1) ALONE is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Statement (2):** s is divisible by 3.\r\nThis tells us s is a multiple of 3, but gives no information about r.\r\n- Case A: Let s=3 and r=4. (r-s) = 4-3 = 1, which is not divisible by 3. (Answer: NO)\r\n- Case B: Let s=3 and r=6. (r-s) = 6-3 = 3, which is divisible by 3. (Answer: YES)\r\nSince we get both YES and NO answers, Statement (2) ALONE is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Combining (1) and (2):**\r\nWe know s is a multiple of 3 (s = 3k for some integer k).\r\nWe also know rs is a multiple of 9. So r(3k) is a multiple of 9, which means rk is a multiple of 3.\r\nThis implies that either r is a multiple of 3, or k is a multiple of 3.\r\n- Case A: Assume r is a multiple of 3. Then r=3m. (r-s) = 3m - 3k = 3(m-k), which is always divisible by 3. (Answer: YES)\r\n- Case B: Assume r is NOT a multiple of 3. Then k must be a multiple of 3.\r\n  Let r=1 (not a multiple of 3) and k=3. This makes s = 3k = 9.\r\n  Let's check our conditions: s=9 is divisible by 3. rs = 1*9 = 9 is divisible by 9. The conditions hold.\r\n  Now, is (r-s) divisible by 3? (1-9) = -8, which is not divisible by 3. (Answer: NO)\r\nSince we can still get both YES and NO answers, the combined statements are NOT sufficient.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is E.`\r\n  },\r\n  2: {\r\n    id: 'A7-q2',\r\n    text: 'From a group consisting of 5 Spaniards, 4 Germans, and 3 Frenchmen, a team is to be formed that includes exactly one Spaniard, one German, and one Frenchman.

Since the median is 12, the mode (15) must appear in the upper half of the set. For it to be the mode, it must appear more than any other number. This means at least two numbers must be 15.
