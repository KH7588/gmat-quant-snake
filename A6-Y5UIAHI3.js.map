Let $\\\\frac{s}{n} = k$, where k is odd. So, $s = nk$.\r\nLet's test two cases:\r\n- Case A: Let n = 2 (even) and the average k = 3 (odd). The sum s = 2 * 3 = 6. The list could be {2, 4}. In this case, all integers are even. The answer to the question is NO.\r\n- Case B: Let n = 2 (even) and the average k = 3 (odd). The sum s is still 6. The list could be {1, 5}. In this case, there are odd integers. The answer to the question is YES.\r\nSince we get both YES and NO, statement (1) is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Statement (2):** The product ns is an even integer.\r\nThis means that either n is even, or s is even, or both are even.\r\nLet's test cases:\r\n- Case A: Let n = 2 (even) and s = 4 (even). The product ns = 8 (even). The list could be {2, 2}. All integers are even. The answer is NO.\r\n- Case B: Let n = 2 (even) and s = 5 (odd). The product ns = 10 (even). The list could be {1, 4} or {2, 3}. In these cases, there is an odd integer. The answer is YES.\r\nSince we get both YES and NO, statement (2) is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n**Combining (1) and (2):**\r\nFrom (1), $\\\\frac{s}{n}$ is an odd integer. From (2), ns is an even integer.\r\nLet $\\\\frac{s}{n} = k$ (odd). Then $s = nk$. Substitute this into the second statement: $n \\\\times (nk) = n^2 \\\\times k$ is even.\r\nSince k is odd, for $n^2 \\\\times k$ to be even, $n^2$ must be even, which means n must be even.\r\nSo, we know n is even and the average (s/n) is odd.\r\nThis brings us back to the same counterexample from statement (1): n=2 (even), average=3 (odd), sum s=6. The list could be {2, 4} (all even, answer NO) or {1, 5} (contains odd, answer YES).\r\nThe combined statements are not sufficient.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is E.`\r\n  },\r\n  2: {\r\n    id: 'A6-q2',\r\n    text: 'The greatest common divisor of the positive integers x and y is d.

This means we can write x = da and y = db, where a and b are integers and gcd(a, b) = 1.\r\n\r\nI. **gcd(x, 1):** The greatest common divisor of any integer and 1 is always 1. Since we are given d > 1, gcd(x, 1) cannot be d.\r\n\r\nII. **gcd(xy, y):** Since y is a factor of both y and xy, the greatest common divisor of xy and y is y. We are given d < y, so gcd(xy, y) is not d.\r\n\r\nIII. **gcd(x - y, y):** This is a property of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor. The property states that gcd(x, y) = gcd(x - y, y).\r\nLet's prove it:\r\nLet g = gcd(x, y). Then g divides x and g divides y. Therefore, g must also divide their difference, x - y. Since g divides both (x - y) and y, it must be a common divisor.\r\nNow let h = gcd(x - y, y). Then h divides y and h divides x - y. Therefore, h must also divide their sum, (x - y) + y = x. Since h divides both x and y, it must be a common divisor.\r\nSince the common divisors are the same, their greatest common divisor must be the same.\r\nSo, gcd(x - y, y) = gcd(x, y) = d. This must be true.\r\n\r\nTherefore, only statement III is correct.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is C.`\r\n  },\r\n  3: {\r\n    id: 'A6-q3',\r\n    text: 'Is the arithmetic mean of the five numbers a, b, c, d, and e greater than the median of these five numbers?',\r\n    statements: [\r\n      'a < b < c < d < e',\r\n      'b-a=e-d'\r\n    ],\r\n    options: DS_OPTIONS,\r\n    correctAnswer: 'E',\r\n    explanation: `The question asks if (a+b+c+d+e)/5 > Median.\r\n\r\n**Statement (1): a < b < c < d < e**\r\nThis tells us that c is the median.

In Town Y, three times as many people are left-handed as are left-handed in Town X, three times as many people are tall as are tall in Town X, three times as many people are both as are both in Town X, but no one is neither. If the total number of people in Town X is four times greater than the total number of people in Town Y, which of the following could be the number of people in Town X who are neither left-handed nor tall?',\r\n    options: [\r\n      { label: \"A\", text: \"23\" },\r\n      { label: \"B\", text: \"39\" },\r\n      { label: \"C\", text: \"70\" },\r\n      { label: \"D\", text: \"143\" },\r\n      { label: \"E\", text: \"199\" }\r\n    ],\r\n    correctAnswer: 'C',\r\n    explanation: `Let L, T, B, N be the number of left-handed, tall, both, and neither people in Town X.\r\nTotal(X) = L + T - B + N.\r\nFor Town Y: L_y = 3L, T_y = 3T, B_y = 3B, N_y=0.\r\nTotal(Y) = L_y + T_y - B_y + N_y = 3L + 3T - 3B = 3(L + T - B).\r\nThe phrase \"four times greater than\" means Total(X) = Total(Y) + 4 * Total(Y) = 5 * Total(Y).\r\nSo, Total(X) = 5 * Total(Y).\r\nLet K = L + T - B. This is the number of people in X with at least one trait.\r\nTotal(X) = K + N.\r\nTotal(Y) = 3K.\r\nSubstitute these into the relationship:\r\nK + N = 5 * (3K)\r\nK + N = 15K\r\nN = 14K\r\nThis means N, the number of people in Town X who are neither, must be a multiple of 14.\r\nChecking the options:\r\n(A) 23 / 14 is not an integer.\r\n(B) 39 / 14 is not an integer.\r\n(C) 70 / 14 = 5. This is an integer.\r\n(D) 143 / 14 is not an integer.\r\n(E) 199 / 14 is not an integer.\r\nThe only possible value is 70.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is C.`\r\n  },\r\n  12: {\r\n    id: 'A6-q12',\r\n    text: 'If there are 10 distinct points lying on the circumference of a circle, how many different triangles can be formed using these points as vertices?',\r\n    options: [\r\n      { label: \"A\", text: \"30\" },\r\n      { label: \"B\", text: \"90\" },\r\n      { label: \"C\", text: \"120\" },\r\n      { label: \"D\", text: \"240\" },\r\n      { label: \"E\", text: \"720\" }\r\n    ],\r\n    correctAnswer: 'C',\r\n    explanation: `This is a combination problem. To form a triangle, we need to choose 3 distinct points from the available 10 points to serve as its vertices.\r\nSince the order in which we choose the points does not matter, we use the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!).\r\nHere, n = 10 (total points) and k = 3 (vertices for a triangle).\r\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)\r\nC(10, 3) = 10! / (3!7!)\r\nC(10, 3) = (10 \u00D7 9 \u00D7 8 \u00D7 7!) / ((3 \u00D7 2 \u00D7 1) \u00D7 7!)\r\nC(10, 3) = (10 \u00D7 9 \u00D7 8) / (3 \u00D7 2 \u00D7 1)\r\nC(10, 3) = 10 \u00D7 3 \u00D7 4 = 120\r\nTherefore, 120 different triangles can be formed.\r\n\r\nThus, the correct answer is C.`\r\n  }\r\n};"],
