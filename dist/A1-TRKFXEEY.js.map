(Answer to question: YES, at least two are the same)\r\n      Since we can have both scenarios, Statement (2) ALONE is NOT sufficient.\r\n\r\n      **Combining Statement (1) and Statement (2):**\r\n      We need four numbers whose sum is \\\\$15$ AND whose product is \\\\$120$.\r\n      Case A: Numbers are distinct.\r\n      The only set of distinct numbers from $\\{1, \\\\dots, 6\\}$ whose product is \\\\$120$ is $\\{1, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\r\n      Let's check their sum: \\\\$1 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 16$. This does NOT satisfy the sum = \\\\$15$ condition.\r\n      Therefore, the four numbers CANNOT be distinct.\r\n      Case B: Numbers are not distinct (at least two are the same).\r\n      We found $\\{2, 3, 5, 5\\}$ sum \\\\$15$, product \\\\$150$ (not \\\\$120$).\r\n      We need to find a set of non-distinct numbers whose sum is \\\\$15$ and product is \\\\$120$.\r\n      Let's check combinations:\r\n      *   $\\{2, 2, 5, 6\\} \\\\Rightarrow \\\\text{Sum} = 2+2+5+6 = 15$. $\\\\text{Product} = 2 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 5 \\\\times 6 = 120$. This set satisfies both conditions, and it contains repeated numbers (\\\\$2$ and \\\\$5$).\r\n      Since the only numbers that satisfy both conditions must be non-distinct, the answer to the question \"Do at least two of the four dice show the same number?\" is definitively YES.\r\n      Therefore, Statement (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient.\r\n\r\n      Thus, the correct answer is C.`\r\n  },\r\n  9: {\r\n    id: 'A1-q9',\r\n    text: 'What is the value of \\\\$2^{2^3} - 2^{3^2}$?',\r\n    options: [\r\n      { label: \"A\", text: '$-2^8$' },\r\n      { label: \"B\", text: '$-2^9$' },\r\n      { label: \"C\", text: '\\\\$2^8$' },\r\n      { label: \"D\", text: '\\\\$2^9$' },\r\n      { label: \"E\", text: '\\\\$1$' }\r\n    ],\r\n    correctAnswer: 'A',\r\n    explanation: `Let's evaluate each term of the expression:\r\n      *   \\\\$2^{2^3} = 2^8$ (since \\\\$2^3 = 8$)\r\n      *   \\\\$2^{3^2} = 2^9$ (since \\\\$3^2 = 9$)\r\n\r\n      So the expression becomes:\r\n      \\\\$2^8 - 2^9$.\r\n\r\n      To simplify this, we can factor out the common term \\\\$2^8$:\r\n      \\\\$2^8 - 2^9 = 2^8 - (2^8 \\\\times 2^1)$\r\n                $= 2^8 \\\\times (1 - 2)$\r\n                $= 2^8 \\\\times (-1)$\r\n                $= -2^8$.\r\n\r\n      Thus, the correct answer is A.`\r\n  },\r\n  10: {\r\n    id: 'A1-q10',\r\n    text: '$(2.5^2 - 1.5^2)+(4.5^2 - 3.5^2)+(6.5^2 - 5.5^2)+\\\\dots+(100.5^2-99.5^2)=?$',\r\n    options: [\r\n      { label: \"A\", text: \"2550\" },\r\n      { label: \"B\", text: \"3100\" },\r\n      { label: \"C\", text: \"5100\" },\r\n      { label: \"D\", text: \"6200\" },\r\n      { label: \"E\", text: \"10200\" }\r\n    ],\r\n    correctAnswer: 'C',\r\n    explanation: `The expression is a sum of terms in the form $(N.5^2 - (N-1).5^2)$.\r\n      Each term can be simplified using the difference of squares formula: $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$.\r\n\r\n      Let's analyze a generic term $(X.5^2 - (X-1).5^2)$:\r\n      $= (X.5 - (X-1).5) \\\\times (X.5 + (X-1).5)$\r\n      $= (1) \\\\times (2X)$\r\n      $= 2X$.\r\n\r\n      Now, let's apply this to each term in the sum:\r\n      1. $(2.5^2 - 1.5^2) = 2 \\\\times 2 = 4$\r\n      2. $(4.5^2 - 3.5^2) = 2 \\\\times 4 = 8$\r\n      3. $(6.5^2 - 5.5^2) = 2 \\\\times 6 = 12$\r\n      $\\\\dots$\r\n      The last term is $(100.5^2 - 99.5^2) = 2 \\\\times 100 = 200$.\r\n\r\n      So the sum is \\\\$4 + 8 + 12 + \\\\dots + 200$.\r\n      This is an arithmetic progression.
