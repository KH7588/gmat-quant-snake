(Not valid, $j$ must be a positive integer)\r\n      \r\n      So, the possible $(k, j)$ pairs are $(1, 6)$ and $(3, 3)$.\r\n      \r\n      **4. Determine how many red marbles could be in Bag A:**\r\n      Red marbles in Bag A = \\\\$2k$.\r\n      *   If $k = 1$, Red marbles in Bag A = \\\\$2(1) = 2$.\r\n      *   If $k = 3$, Red marbles in Bag A = \\\\$2(3) = 6$.\r\n      \r\n      The possible number of red marbles in Bag A are \\\\$2$ or \\\\$6$.\r\n      Looking at the options, \\\\$6$ is one of the choices.\r\n      \r\n      Thus, the correct answer is D.`\r\n  },\r\n};"],
