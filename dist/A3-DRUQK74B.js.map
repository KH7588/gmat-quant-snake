Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient.\r\n      \r\n      **Statement (2):** The sum of the four-digit integer \"$\\\\mathbf{abcd}$\" and the three-digit integer \"$\\\\mathbf{dba}$\" is \\\\$1,957$.\r\n      $(1000a + 100b + 10c + d) + (100d + 10b + a) = 1957$\r\n      Group like terms:\r\n      \\\\$1001a + 110b + 10c + 101d = 1957$\r\n      \r\n      Again, $a, b, c, d$ are distinct non-zero digits (1-9).\r\n      We need to find values for $a, b, c, d$ that satisfy this.\r\n      Since \"dba\" is a three-digit integer, $d$ cannot be \\\\$0$, which is already given.\r\n      \r\n      Consider the units digit: $d + a$.\r\n      From \\\\$1001a + 110b + 10c + 101d = 1957$, let's look at the last digit:\r\n      The units digit of \\\\$1001a$ is $a$.\r\n      The units digit of \\\\$110b$ is \\\\$0$.\r\n      The units digit of \\\\$10c$ is \\\\$0$.\r\n      The units digit of \\\\$101d$ is $d$.\r\n      So the units digit of the sum is $(a+d) \\\\pmod{10} = 7$.\r\n      Possible pairs for $(a,d)$ with distinct non-zero digits summing to \\\\$7$ or \\\\$17$:\r\n      *   $a+d = 7$: $(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)$\r\n      *   $a+d = 17$: $(8,9), (9,8)$\r\n      \r\n      Now consider the thousands place for \\\\$1957$. Since it's a four-digit number + a three-digit number, '$a$' must be small.\r\n      If $a = 1$, then the sum is approx \\\\$1000 + 100b + 10c + 101d$.\r\n      From \\\\$1001a + 110b + 10c + 101d = 1957$\r\n      If $a=1$: \\\\$1001(1) + 110b + 10c + 101d = 1957$\r\n      \\\\$1001 + 110b + 10c + 101d = 1957$\r\n      \\\\$110b + 10c + 101d = 956$\r\n      \r\n      Now, check $d$ based on $a+d=7$ or $a+d=17$. Since $a=1$, $d$ must be \\\\$6$ (from $a+d=7$).\r\n      Substitute $d=6$:\r\n      \\\\$110b + 10c + 101(6) = 956$\r\n      \\\\$110b + 10c + 606 = 956$\r\n      \\\\$110b + 10c = 350$\r\n      Divide by \\\\$10$: \\\\$11b + c = 35$\r\n      \r\n      We need distinct non-zero digits for $b$ and $c$, also distinct from $a=1$ and $d=6$.\r\n      *   If $b=1, c=24$ (not a digit)\r\n      *   If $b=2, 22+c=35 \\\\Rightarrow c=13$ (not a digit)\r\n      *   If $b=3, 33+c=35 \\\\Rightarrow c=2$.\r\n          Here, $(a,b,c,d) = (1,3,2,6)$. All are distinct non-zero digits.\r\n          $a+d = 1+6 = 7$\r\n          $b+c = 3+2 = 5$\r\n          Product $(a+d)(b+c) = 7 \\\\times 5 = 35$.\r\n      \r\n      This solution $(1,3,2,6)$ works and gives $(a+d)(b+c) = 35$.\r\n      Could there be other solutions for $(a,b,c,d)$?\r\n      What if $a=2$? Then \\\\$1001(2) = 2002$, which is already $> 1957$. So '$a$' must be \\\\$1$.\r\n      This means $(a,b,c,d) = (1,3,2,6)$ is the unique set of digits.\r\n      Therefore, $(a+d)(b+c) = 35$.
